# Activate retention time
#   You can decide whether or not to delete incremets older than
#+  $RETENTION time (see below). If you won't activate this pay attention
#+  to the disk space that will be getting bigger.
#   Set this variable to TRUE to activate or leave it blank switch off deletion.
#   Ex: DELETEOLDER=""

  DELETEOLDER="TRUE"

# Retention Time
#  You can set the retention time, above which rdiff-backup increments
#+ will not be conserved. The format of this variable MUST be as stated

#N.B.: at the moment is not possible to disable deletion of increments older
#+ than $RETENTION...consider it a ToDo
